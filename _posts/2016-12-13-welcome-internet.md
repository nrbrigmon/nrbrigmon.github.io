### Hey there, World
I want to give back, so I started this blog. I'm a self taught programmer with a background in Business and Urban Planning. I never would have come this far without the thousands of articles, posts, questions, comments, and replies on stackoverflow, reddit, scotch.io, codeacademy, udemy, freecodecamp, edX, and more. Now that I've reached a small niche in my own little world, I've discovered that I'm solving problems others haven't really come across. Now, it's time to give back.

My code of choice *in* a particular order:
1. JavaScript (the language of the future, amiright? I have no idea...)
2. Python (GIS programming and task automation mostly)
3. Google App Scripts
4. CityEngine's CGA
5. Excel VBA
